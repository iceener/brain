Instead of trying to predict where I want to go, I just have a clear direction in which I'm heading. This may be equated with a vision or life philosophy, which I wrote more about when I was writing about my [[Foundations/Values]]\n\nWith a clearly defined direction, I just have to make sure, that I'm continually optimize my [[Knowledge/Dictionary/Process]] and moving with the same pace (see more at [[Knowledge/Mental models/20 mile march]]).\n\n## Where I'm going to?\nI strive to **continuously grow** and **inspire others to grow**. \nI'm doing so in the **most effective way possible**, operating at **maximum available scale** by utilising [[Knowledge/Mental models/Leverage]].\n\nThis statement appears in every day in almost every action I take. \nTo put this clearly - **this is what my life is all about.**\n\n## How I've defined my Direction?\nActually it was a pretty long process. In a some way I was feeling this all the time, but it wasn't easy to put this in a simple words. Most of the activities I have described here: [[Foundations/Understanding myself]].\n\n## Do I use goals? \nOf course I do. I believe in a some situations that's a good thing to have something you are aiming for. But in the same time I keep in mind, that goals may give me a disillusion, disappointment or even worse. I just try to keep my both eyes on what I'm doing right now, instead of thinking what will happen in the future. I've learned a lot about a proper attitude towards goals from books [[Knowledge/Books/Chop Wood Carry Water]] and [[Knowledge/Books/Way of The Peaceful Warrior]]","lastmodified":"2022-10-28T02:40:50.156844752Z","tags":null},"/Foundations/Journal":{"title":"Journal","content":"I keep a Journal on [[Optimization/Hardware/iPad]] in an [[Optimization/Tools/Notability]] app. I wrote my first notes in the [[Bear]] app back in 2016. Then I've realised that taking notes by hand is way better because of many reasons. For example I can go back to my notes and see emotions reflected in my writing character.\n\n## Why I keep my Journal?\nThis is a way for me to \"getting the garbage out of your head\" (a concept from [[Knowledge/People/Dan Millman]]).\n\nBesides, writing is a way to express my thoughts and emotions. Writing improves one's thinking process, which is something I care about a lot. A similar role is played by [[Knowledge/Mental models/Mental models]]. In a simple words - **by writing I'm learninig how to think.**\n\nIn addition to writing, I also read my journal, which gives me a [[Knowledge/Dictionary/Perspective]] (for ex. By looking at yourself and your attitudes from years ago).\n\n## Rules\n- Every rule may be broken\n- I write practically every day\n- I don't have a set time or structure\n- I am honest with myself according to [[Knowledge/Thoughts/Radical Transparency]] from a books [[Knowledge/Books/Principles]] and [[Knowledge/Books/That Will Never Work]]\n- I do not have a requirement for quantity\n- I write what is in my mind at the moment\n- Sometimes I write in the third person in order to gain distance from the written words\n- I often return to notes written months and years earlier\n\n## Regularity\nIn my opinion, one of the biggest myths that exist, and at the same time obstacles, to keeping a diary, is the belief and suggestions that it must happen daily.\n\nIt was only since I defined the above-mentioned rules that I was able to adjust the diary keeping to my daily rhythm and changing conditions and unforeseen situations. \n\nSuch freedom from artificial rules ([[Knowledge/Books/Letting Go]]), made me able to develop an iron habit of writing a diary (more at [[Knowledge/Books/Atomic Habits]])\n\n## Returning\nI know many people who keeps a diary. But none of them have ever told me that they not only write it but also go back to notes from years ago.\n\nI don't do it regularly, but whenever I have more free time. Almost every time is a time of great reflection and an influx of ideas and new energy. \n\nThe most important value from this activity is the new perspective [[Knowledge/Dictionary/Perspective]].","lastmodified":"2022-10-28T02:40:50.156844752Z","tags":null},"/Foundations/Knowledge-acquisition-system":{"title":"Knowledge acquisition system","content":"I see the ability to **acquire knowledge quickly** as one of the most important, especially in the face of a very fast-changing world. As such, it is a skill that can simply be developed.\n\nFor example, I see from myself that my memory has become incomparably better over the past few years. I could be wrong but I assume they have an effect on this:\n\n- reading [[Knowledge/Books/Books]]\n- listening to i.e.:  [[Knowledge/Podcasts/Huberman Lab]]\n- taking care of [[Foundations/Process#The foundation]] (for example, about sleep and rest)\n- much less stress\n\n## How do I learn new topics?\nIt's a process based on **surrounding myself with a chosen topic** based on the **best available sources**, which I choose carefully. I believe they define how effectively I learn.\n\nSources are usually centered around people or projects. There are also people around them who are worth watching. We can say that it is a network of connections that allows us to reach out to more sources and thus shape our entire environment.\n\n[[Knowledge/Books/Books]] are another part of the knowledge acquisition process. The key is just to choose the right titles. The aforementioned sources help with this.\n\n**Basically:** \n- Reading a book is in a way, like a conversation with an author\n- I treat the whole process as fun and having a good time\n- I accept everything I find with openness and detachment\n\t- openness: I assume that the information is true and valuable\n\t- distance: I don't trust her 100% and assume she may be misleading me\n\t- A combination of openness and detachment offers the opportunity to develop **better** practices than those recommended by the best\n- I reach out to the best possible sources (blogs, articles, youtube channels, twitter accounts, online courses)\n- I get to know people who are at the root of a topic (such as technology developers or prominent experts). I usually do this on Twitter or Instagram\n- I discover titles of recommended books and those that intrigue me\n- I subscribe to the newsletters of the above-mentioned people\n\n## How much am I study?\nI don't measure it in any way, but learning is practically an integral part of my day. This means that I use practically every free moment to learn something new. At the same time, I also have space for total non-thinking, rest and silence, which I also see as a very important part of the process of acquiring knowledge.\n\n## Detailed process\nNa [[Projects/Ahoy!]] I described the detailed process of how I learn (polish only):\n\n![](https://space.overment.com/Screen-Shot-2022-05-02-17-34-46-wwzjR/Screen-Shot-2022-05-02-17-34-46.png)\n\nLink: [How Do I Learn?

I am constantly questioning, modifying and improving it. It probably **will not work for you**, but you will certainly find plenty of inspiration and resources to help you build your own.\n\n\u003e Everyone is constantly telling you what is good for you. They don't want you to look for your own answers. They want you to believe in theirs. ~ [[Knowledge/People/Dan Millman]]\n\n## Context\n\nIt is widely accepted that setting a [[Knowledge/Dictionary/Goal]]s is **essential to achieving results.** Others say it's better to work on a [[Knowledge/Dictionary/Process]] basis.\n\nI myself act on the basis of the [[Knowledge/Dictionary/Goal]] AND [[Knowledge/Dictionary/Process]] (a concept [[Knowledge/Mental models/Genius of The AND]] from [[Knowledge/People/Jim Collins]]).\n\nIn practice, I find it difficult to determine the future for more than a week ahead. It's not uncommon for me to have no idea what I'll be doing the next day. At the same time, I have a general outline of where I am going.\n\n### Goals\n\nA well-defined goal [[Knowledge/Dictionary/Goal]] determines the end result and a deadline (\\([SMART](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/smart-goals.htm)\\)). Combined with the visualization of a realized goal, we form the right attitudes (e.g., enthusiasm -\u003e [[Foundations/Values]]).\n\nFor a large target, simply divide it into smaller ones to reduce \"resistance\" ([[Knowledge/Books/War of Art]]). The realization of smaller goals imparts [[Momentum]] through, among other things, the use of dopamine, about which more is said by [[Knowledge/People/Andrew Huberman#Motywacja Drive]]\n\n**In practice, the goals have drawbacks:** \n- goals build [[Knowledge/Thoughts/Expectations]] that may not match [[Knowledge/Thoughts/Reality]]\n- goals build that may not agree with (the result)\n- we never know IF we really want it\n- we never know what we're really going to get [[Knowledge/People/Dan Millman#Oczekiwania wobec celu]]\n- realizing a big goal has an effect **\"well, but now what?!\"**\n- giving up the target or modifying it is not easy (i.e. because of [[Knowledge/Mental models/Commitment Bias]] and/or [[Knowledge/Mental models/Status quo bias]]\n\nAmong other reasons, I use targets on a case-by-case basis. Previously, I used a [[OKR]] system. Today I mainly operate on the basis of [[Knowledge/Dictionary/Process]] and [[Knowledge/Dictionary/Direction]]. \n\n### Direction vs. Goal\n- [[Knowledge/Dictionary/Goal]] The goal has an implementation date and conditions for its fulfillment, [[Knowledge/Dictionary/Direction]] does not have them.\n- By definition, a direction can be followed but not reached.\n- The difference between one and the other has a big narrative role and as [[Knowledge/People/David Goggins]] says, The dialogue we have with ourselves is the most important of all.\n\n### Process\nI operate on the basis of a continuously optimized [[Knowledge/Dictionary/Process]] that takes into account: \n\n* Fundamenty (sleep, diet, sports, being bored)\n* Getting to know yourself (journal writing and reading it, StrengthsFinder, MBTI, Principles You).\n* Surrounding environment (people I spend time with).\n* Development of [[Foundations/Knowledge acquisition system]], learning about [[Knowledge/Mental models/Mental models]] and reading [[Knowledge/Books/Books]]\n* Using of a ([[Knowledge/Mental models/Leverage]])) \\(my hour generates a multiplying effect\\)\n* Freedom \\(I don't sell my time, avoid planned activities\\)\n\n\u003e Discipline equals Freedom ~ [[Knowledge/People/Jocko Willink]]\n\n**In designing my process, I rely on:**\n\n- Curiosity - because it's what leads us to unimaginable places.\n- Open-mindedness - also to the fact that I, as well as any other person, simply may be wrong and something that is even widely accepted as truth may have little to do with it.\n- In implementing this process, the most important thing for me is to maintain a [[Knowledge/Thoughts/Discipline]] A discipline that Jocko Willink [[Knowledge/People/Jocko Willink]] talks a lot about and [[Knowledge/People/David Goggins]] writes in his book [[Knowledge/Books/Cant Hurt Me]]. \n- In designing the process, I pay attention to [[Knowledge/Mental models/Ergodicity]] and ([[Knowledge/Mental models/Leverage]]) and compound interest ([[Knowledge/Books/The Compound Effect]])\n- [[Knowledge/People/Dan Millman]] and his book [[Knowledge/Books/Way of The Peaceful Warrior]] and [[Knowledge/Books/How to Fail at Almost Anything and Still Win Big]] i [[Knowledge/Books/Pound the Stone]] has played a huge role in my attitude towards a process.\n- Taking full responsibility for what I do ([[Knowledge/Books/Extreme Ownership]]) and full commitment ([[Knowledge/Books/Skin in the Game]])\n- Simply acting ([[Knowledge/Books/Do the Work]], [[Knowledge/Books/War of Art]])\n- Letting go ([[Knowledge/Books/Letting Go]], [[The Dip]])\n- Constant questioning ([[Knowledge/Books/Think Again]]) and simplifying ([[Knowledge/Books/Simplify]] and [[Knowledge/Books/Insanely Simple]] and [[Knowledge/Books/Effortless]])\n- Acting on reality ([[Knowledge/Books/Principles]], [[Knowledge/Books/Deviate]] i [[Knowledge/Books/Getting Real]])\n- Allowing mistakes to be made ([[Knowledge/Books/Black Box Thinking]] i [[Knowledge/Books/Think Like a Rocket Scientist]])\n- Moving at the edge of your competence\n- Continuous learning and staying current\n- Acting on habits ([[Knowledge/Books/Atomic Habits]] i [[Knowledge/Books/Deep Work]])\n- Leveraging ([[Knowledge/Mental models/Leverage]] i [[Knowledge/Books/The Compound Effect]])\n- Long-term action ([[Knowledge/Books/The Infinite Game]], [[Knowledge/Books/Pound the Stone]], [[Knowledge/Books/So Good They Cant Ignore You]] oraz [[Knowledge/Books/How to Fail at Almost Anything and Still Win Big]])\n- Acting on intuition ([[Knowledge/Books/Blink]])\n- Acting on things that make me stronger([[Knowledge/Books/Antifragile]] i [[Knowledge/Books/Fooled by Randomness]])\n- Not giving up ([[Knowledge/Books/Grit]] and [[Knowledge/Books/That Will Never Work]])\n- Learning everything, about everything ([[Knowledge/Books/Way of The Peaceful Warrior]], [[Knowledge/Books/Range]] i [[Knowledge/Books/Rebel Ideas]])\n- Making smart decisions ([[Knowledge/Books/All I Want to Know is Where Im Going to Die So Ill Never Go There]], [[Knowledge/Books/The Great Mental Models]], [[Knowledge/Books/Seeking Wisdom]], [[Knowledge/Books/Gladiators Pirates and Games of Trust]])\n- Understanding myslef (this is the foundation) ([[Knowledge/Books/Understanding the INFJ Personality Type]] and [[StrenghtsFinder 2.0]])\n- Questioning authority [[Knowledge/Mental models/Authority bias]] including myself\n- Shaping and updating the so-called Models of Reality ([[Knowledge/Books/The Code Of The Extraordinary Mind]])\n- Bending reality to my will [[Knowledge/Books/Cant Hurt Me]]\n\n## My [[Knowledge/Dictionary/Process]]\n\n### The foundation\nThe foundation for me is health (physical and mental) and sleep.\n\n- **Regular sleep**. - [[Knowledge/People/Andrew Huberman#Master Your Sleep]]. I do not use additional aids beside of Ashwagandha. I avoid screens before bedtime.\n- **Diet** - Regular seasons of eating vitamin D, K, Omega 3 and magnesium. Once every quarter of 30 days of bee pollen diluted overnight in boiled, cooled water (⚠️ NOTE: bee pollen is a strong allergen).\n- **Sport** - [3x a week](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine) + daily stretching with [[Optimization/Tools/Romwod]]\n- Breathing exercises with [[Optimization/Tools/Oak]] \u0026 tips from [[Knowledge/People/Andrew Huberman#Oddychanie]]\n- [[Medytacja]] ~20-30 minutes a day with [[Optimization/Tools/Headspace]], [[Optimization/Tools/Waking Up]] and [[Optimization/Tools/Reveri]]\n- [[Knowledge/Thoughts/Boredom]] - a key element in remaining creative\n- I practice the ability to focus on the basis of [[Knowledge/Books/Deep Work]] and I often listen to [[Optimization/Tools/Endel.io]]\n\n### Getting to know myself\nGetting to know myself is the most important part of my process after the foundations.\n\n- **Keeping a [[Foundations/Journal]]**\n- **Personality Tests**. - [[Foundations/Understanding myself#MBTI]], [[Foundations/Understanding myself#StrenghtsFinder]], [[Foundations/Understanding myself#Principles You]], [[Foundations/Understanding myself#The Big Five]]\n- **Spending time alone with yourself** - without distractions and the Internet\n- **Staying open** - I try to stay open to making mistakes. ([[Knowledge/Books/Think Like a Rocket Scientist]] \u0026 [[Knowledge/Books/Black Box Thinking]]) and the fact that I could be wrong.\n\n### Surroundings\nI believe that it is impossible to change fundamentally, while our beliefs and habits can change. The biggest influence is not our immediate environment[[Knowledge/Dictionary/Surrounding]] and active ([[Knowledge/Books/Atomic Habits]])\n\n* **Nearest [[Knowledge/Dictionary/Surrounding]]** - I pay attention to who I spend the most time with.\n* **Proactivity** - I actively maintain contact with selected individuals.\n* **Discovery** - I intentionally reach out to people I feel I want to have contact with.\n* **Limitation** - I eliminate meeting and being among people who take away my energy (or I take away theirs). Restrictions also improve the process [[Knowledge/Thoughts/Decision-making]]\n\n\u003e Surround yourself with people who have achieved what you want to achieve and have something in common with them.\n\n### Working style\nI often receive questions \"How do you embrace it all?\". There is no secret to this and it consists of three things:\n- I work quite a bit (~8-12 hours a day 6 days a week)\n- I maintain as much [[Knowledge/Thoughts/Focus]] as possible \n- I am streamlining the implemented processes by using [[Optimization/Automation/Automation]]\n\nIn other words, I do everything to make the best use of my time. For this it is necessary to build a strong [[Foundations/Process#Fundamenty]] As well as space to rest effectively. One of the most important suggestions I received on this topic was as follows: \"Adam, if you work hard, you must also rest to the max\". I completely agree with this.\n\n#### 🔗 Sources:\n- [[Knowledge/People/Naval Ravikant#Naval Kapil Gupta]]\n- [[Knowledge/People/Andrew Huberman#Rich Roll]]\n- [Marek Kaczmarzyk na TEDxBydgoszcz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivLcmB_Gogc\u0026feature=emb_title) - \"If so much information reaches our brain every second, how are the most relevant ones selected? The answer is: **the most important information for our brain is an information about another brain.\"\n\n### Development\nRealizing and developing my [[Knowledge/Dictionary/Process]] is a priority for me. I base it almost 100% on English-language sources.\n\n- [[Knowledge/Mental models/Mental models]] - understanding and using them is a superpower, it helps in thinking and decision-making - and I believe that our lives are about them.\n- [[Knowledge/Books/Books]] - reading is for me one of the main elements of my development process\n- [[Knowledge/Podcasts/Podcast]]\n- Specialization and Generalization - I do not have any specialization. I learn everything about everything ([[Knowledge/Books/Range]] \u0026 [[T-Shape Leader]])\n\n### Knowledge acquisition system\nThis is my way of quickly learning new skills and staying current in my circle of skills and knowledge ([[Knowledge/Mental models/Circle of Competence]]).\n\nSee more 👉 [[Foundations/Knowledge acquisition system]].\n\n\n### [[Knowledge/Mental models/Leverage]]\n\n\u003e Give me a point of support and I will move the earth. ~ Archimedes\n\nThe concept of leverage ([[Knowledge/Mental models/Leverage]]) is one of the most important I know. Thanks to her, once done the work gives me results for years.\n\n- My time is not for sale ([[Knowledge/Books/Principles]]) - Since Q2 2020, I have made the decision not to sell my time. For example, I have almost completely reduced consulting and assignments for clients in favor of developing my own products. I only do this in situations where it either makes me happy or gives me benefits beyond financial.  \n- I take actions that take advantage of scale and help others for a long time.\n- When taking action, I ask myself \"How to make 100 out of my one hour?\" [[Knowledge/Mental models/Leverage]]\n- [[Optimization/Optimization]] - I pay attention to small details. I eliminate them or optimize them (e.g., by simplifying) to the limit (or reasonable).\n- [[Optimization/Automation/Automation]] - I automate many areas of my activity. I have an army of robots that work for me day and night.\n\n\u003e The most interesting and important form of leverage is the idea of a product with minimal replication cost. ~ [[Knowledge/People/Naval Ravikant]]\n\n### Finance \nI base my income almost entirely on asymmetrical sources of income: subscriptions, commissions, shares and investments.\n\nCombining this with optimizing my [[Foundations/Process]] with each passing day, the value I generate and my earnings increase disproportionately to my time commitment.\n\n#### 🔗 Sources:\n\t\n* [[Knowledge/People/Naval Ravikant]] about a [[Knowledge/Mental models/Leverage]] [https://nav.al/product-media](https://nav.al/product-media)\n* Trends VC on 1-person, million-dollar business [https://trends.vc/trends-0065-million-dollar-one-person-businesses/](https://trends.vc/trends-0065-million-dollar-one-person-businesses/)","lastmodified":"2022-10-28T02:40:50.156844752Z","tags":null},"/Foundations/Understanding-myself":{"title":"Getting to know yourself","content":"\u003e  Temet Nosce (ltn. Know Thyself)\n\n## Context\n\u003e ⚠️ Personality tests are tools. They don't define anything, they just point out useful parts. Their greatest advantage is that they encourage self-reflection and comparison of their results with reality.\n\n\u003e Performing the test does not give much. I only became effective after exploring the enclosed materials and reading books about them. \n\n## MBTI\n[[Knowledge/Other/MBTI]] or otherwise known as the 16 personality test (although according to some sources MBTI is not 16 personalities). Recommended by [[Knowledge/People/Ray Dalio]].  He wrote in [[Knowledge/Books/Principles]] that he built a team based on MBTI, developing the world's largest investment fund almost from scratch.\n\n\u003e ℹ️ According to some sources, the 16 personality test has little to do with the MBTI.\n\nMy Profile: **INFJ**.\n\nIn order to explore the profile, I read, among other things:\n- [[Knowledge/Books/Understanding the INFJ Personality Type]]\n- and [this document](https://idigitalcitizen.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/infj-profile-counselor-protector-pdf2.pdf)\n\n**Key findings:**\n- INFJ is a profile of contradictions\n- I rely almost entirely on my intuition ([[Knowledge/Books/Blink]])\n- I have a rather ambivalent nature\n- The profile itself is very rare (1-3% of humanity of which 50% are men)\n- I can read even subtle emotions and feelings with ease\n- I am highly sensitive ([[Knowledge/Books/Daring Greatly]] helped me understand the subject)\n\n## StrenghtsFinder\n[[Knowledge/Other/StrenghtsFinder]] otherwise known as the Gallup test. One of the most widely recommended tools for development. It is based on discovering one's natural predispositions, which if developed can become strengths.\n\nMy results:\n\n![StrengthsFinder](https://space.overment.com/m75PbJuix3DuFiQPHBW4/Screen-Shot-2021-08-16-02-59-51.png)\n\n**My work process with Gallup:**.\n- I have read **all** the attached materials on all the talents.\n- I wrote down the most important suggestions from TOP15\n- I wrote down the observations (i.e. how it looks in my case)\n- I wrote down the conclusions (i.e. how the observations relate to their suggestions)\n- I wrote down an action plan (i.e. what activities I undertake to develop my talents)\n- I translated everything into real activities. Some of them I still implement today.\n\nI think StrengthsFinder played a huge role in my life but only because I very actively worked with the information I received there.\n\n⚠️ The above test results are from the second attempt, undertaken several years later after the first. For comparison, I post the result of the first attempt below:\n\n![](https://space.overment.com/Shared-Image-2021-11-09-00-59-54/Shared-Image-2021-11-09-00-59-54.png)\n\nHere it is necessary to take into account several important elements that took place between the execution of the tests. These include:\n- a complete change of environment\n- a huge professional change (leaving the company)\n- several years of therapy with a psychologist\n\nI do not judge these changes, but I can certainly say that they reflect a current state.

I can only recommend its purchase and add that I followed all the steps, according to his suggestions.\n\n## Are the values changing? \nIn my case, enthusiasm has been on the list relatively recently. The reason for this was [[Knowledge/Thoughts/Moment of Realization]] that took place when I read the book [[Knowledge/Books/Alamanck of Naval Ravikant]]. One of the quotes of [[Knowledge/People/Naval Ravikant]] said that feeling happy is a matter of our decision.\n\nFrom that point on, I decided to take it seriously, contrary to what [[Knowledge/Other/The Big Five]] test told me, suggesting that in terms of enthusiasm I am in the 1st percentile (lowest).\n\nAt the same time, books such as.

It is a collection and interpretation of statements made by [[Naval Ravikant]]-a well-known Silicon Valley investor who made early investments in companies such as Notion, Twitter and Uber.\n\nNaval places great emphasis in this book on leverage (eng. [[Knowledge/Mental models/Leverage]]) based on the creation of products whose cost of replication is marginal.\n\nIn addition to his professional successes, Naval stands out for his special wisdom and the fact that he is simply happy and this does not always go hand in hand with professional success.\n\n\u003e Every great programmer today already has an army of robots working for him day and night, even when he is sleeping ([[Optimization/Automation/Automation]]).\n\n## Concepts\n\n### Wealth vs. Money/Status Game\n- Wealth ([[Wealth Game]]) is a resource that works for you even when you sleep.\n- Money is a way of transforming time and wealth\n- Status is your position in the social hierarchy\n\nIt is good to live playing the [[Wealth Game]] instead of the [[Status Game]]. In particular, it is useful to understand how to create based on ethics and ignore people who function based on Status Game - they gain it by attacking people who build their wealth.\n\n### [[Specific Knowledge]]\n[Specific Knowledge]] is a type of knowledge that cannot be transferred and its automation is not possible. If someone can teach you something, it means they can also teach someone else.\n\nSuch knowledge, in my opinion, flows from a combination of natural predispositions ([[Foundations/Understanding myself]]), hard work ([[Knowledge/Dictionary/Process]]), and combining that with the unique qualities of our character.\n\n### [[Knowledge/Mental models/Leverage]]\nAccording to Naval, business leverage comes from Capital, People and Products having low or zero cost of replication (code and media).\n\n### [[Konkurencja]]\n🚧\n\n\n## Lessons\n- Learn to build and sell: you will become unstoppable\n- You will never be worth more than you think. In a business context, set yourself your hourly rate and work as if you actually earn that much\n- Independence is more important than how much you earn. It is what gives you space and control.\n- When was the last time you were bored? [Knowledge/Thoughts/Boredom]] gives space, space is an element of creativity\n- If you can't decide, the answer is NO\n- If you are making a decision, choose the option that is more difficult in the short term.\n- Happiness is a matter of our decision\n\nAnd many, many others.","lastmodified":"2022-10-28T02:40:50.156844752Z","tags":null},"/Knowledge/Books/All-I-Want-to-Know-is-Where-Im-Going-to-Die-So-Ill-Never-Go-There":{"title":"All I Want to Know is Where Im Going to Die So Ill Never Go There","content":"One of the more interesting form of books I've read.

One of the questions he asked himself was 'why do some people stand out from the crowd so much?' \n\nAfter years of research, they concluded that one of the most important elements is to develop one's strengths, rather than trying to bring weaknesses to a 'normal level'.\n\nThe result is StrenghtsFinder, which is designed to help us identify our talents and provide insight into how we can turn them into our strengths.\n\n## Talent vs Strengths\n- Talent is a natural fit for us.\n- Strengths are talents performed near perfection\n\nIn practice, StrengthsFinder helps us identify our Talents, but only by working on them can they become strengths for us.\n\n## How to take the 'Gallup Test'?\nI myself used the instructions on a [blog of Dominik Juszczyk](https://dominikjuszczyk.pl/2016/03/jak-zrobic-test-strengthsfinder-po-polsku/). \n\nI also recommend all of Dominic's work on the subject of the Gallup Test.\n\n⚠️ Note: the test has ~180 questions and you should reserve a minimum of 2 hours to complete it.\n\n## Version 5 or 34?\nInitially I did the version discovering 5 talents and later unlocked the other results.\n\nIn my opinion, it is a good approach to first properly focus your attention on the TOP5 that are worth working on the most.

Zainstalowanie CLI: `npm i -g @nestjs/cli` \n2. Utworzenie nowego projektu `nest new [nazwa]`\n\n## Struktura projektu \nPodstawową struktury kodu w NestJS są klasy (eng. [[classes]]) oraz dekoratory (eng. [[decorators]]). \n\n## [[Controllers]]\n\nControllery to klasy, których zadaniem jest obsługa akcji poszczególnych ścieżek ([[routing]]) aplikacji. Przykładowo jeżeli użytkownik wejdzie na adres `https://brain.overment.com` to na pewnym etapie akcja controllera pobierze niezbędne dane i zwróci odpowiedź. \n\nW NestJS controller można powiązać ze ścieżką, wykorzystując parametry przekazane do dekoratora Controllera oraz jego Akcji.\n\nPowiązanie controllera ze ścieżką '/users':\n```\n@Controller('users')\nexport class UsersController {}\n```\n\nPowiązanie akcji controllera ze ścieżką /users/:id. Dodatkowo ta akcja przyjmuje również parametr `id`.\n```\nexport class UsersController {\n  **@Get('id')**\n  find(@Param('id') id: number) {\n  \treturn `User: ${id}`;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAkcje kontrolera mogą przyjmować również `request body`. \n```\nexport class UsersController {\n  @Post()\n  find(@Body() body) {\n  \treturn `User: ${body.id}`;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAkcje mogą przyjmować też parametry `query string`\n```\nexport class UsersController {\n  @Get()\n  find(@Query() query) {\n  \treturn `User: ${query.id}`;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAkcje mogą zwracać kod statusu\n```\nexport class UsersController {\n  @Post()\n  @HttpCode(HttpStatus.OK)\n  find(@Body() body) {}\n}\n```\n\n### Tworzenie controllerów\nZ pomocą CLI: `nest g co` (lub `nest generate controller`) tworzymy plik controllera i spec.ts.\n- flaga --no-spec umożliwia utworzenie controllera bez pliku spec.ts\n- podając w nazwie katalog, umieścisz go w podkatalogu\n- flaga --dry-run umożliwia przetestowanie polecenia\n\n\n\n## [[Services]]\nSerwisy umożliwiają rozdzielenie logiki naszej aplikacji na mniejsze części, ułatwiając jej organizację. \n\n\nPrzykład serwisu:\n```\n@Injectable()\nexport class UsersService {}\n```\n\nDodawanie serwisu np. do controllera odbywa się w konstruktorze: \n```\n@Controller()\nexport class UsersController {\n  constructor(private readonly usersService: UsersService)\n  // private declares and initializes field\n}\n```\n\n### Tworzenie serwisów\nZ pomocą CLI `nest g s` (lub `nest generate service`) tworzymy plik serwisu i spec.ts\n\nSerwis to zwykła klasa z dektoratorem @Injectable()\n\nW Nest.js każdy serwis to [[Provider]]. Oznacza to, że serwisy mogą przyjmować zależności np. w postaci innych serwisów. \n\n\n## [[Modules]]\nW NestJS moduły pozwalają na organizowanie logiki biznesowej powiązanych ze sobą fragmentów (np. AuthModule)\n\nDekorator @Module przyjmuje obiekt zawierający informację o: \n- controllerach (z których korzysta dany moduł)\n- exportowanych providerach, które mają być dostępne tam, gdzie importowany jest moduł\n- importowanych modułach\n- wykorzystywanych providerach, które będą dostępne tylko w tym module\n\n### Tworzenie modułów\nZ pomocą CLI `nest g module` tworzymy nowy moduł aplikacji oraz aktualizujemy główny moduł aplikacji (src/app.module.ts)\n## [[Data Transfer Objects]]\nDTO pozwalają na określenie interfejsów dla danych wejściowych i wyjściowych w aplikacji. Np. z ich pomocą możemy określić kształt wymaganego obiektu. \n\nDTO to proste obiekty, których rolą jest po prostu określenie struktury danych. Nie zawierają żadnej logiki biznesowej ani czegokolwiek, co wymaga testowania.\n\nPrzykład: \n```\nexport class CreateUserDto {\n  name: string;\n  brand: string;\n  flavors: string[];\n}\n```\n\n### Tworzenie DTO\nZ pomocą CLI `nest g class users/dto/create-user.dto --no-spec`generujemy plik `create-user.dto.ts` eksportujący klasę `CreateUserDto`\n\n## [[Validation]]\n- W pliku main.ts dodaj globalPipe: app.useGlobalPipes(new ValidationPipe())\n- Zainstaluj class-validator class-transformer\n\nimport { IsString } from 'class-validator'\n\n```\nexport class CreateUserDto {\n  @IsString()\n  readonly name: string;\n  \n  @IsString({ roles })\n  readonly roles: string[];\n}\n```","lastmodified":"2022-10-28T02:40:50.168844759Z","tags":null},"/Knowledge/Programming/NestJS/Upload-plik%C3%B3w":{"title":"Upload plików","content":"## Upload plików w Nest.js z

What is Curiosity to me?\nCuriosity overcomes all limitations and leads to unimaginable places. It is the absolute foundation of my functioning.\n\nTo many people, productivity seems to require mastering amazing work techniques and using amazing tools. Despite all my enthusiasm for both of these things, I believe they are merely an add-on. Especially when we find that most of our energy is burned out by our worries, fears, fighting the aforementioned resistance or trying to realize exorbitant expectations. The list is very long.\n\nCuriosity makes all these things cease to have any meaning and almost 100% of your energy begins to focus on action.\n\nCuriosity frees us from fear, makes us overlook fear, because we have nothing to fear. And since there is no fear, there is also no resistance. Instead, there is pure exploration, discovery and fun. Then even making mistakes is fully what it should be: a lesson and a pointer to correct course on the way to the goal.\n\nUltimately, curiosity yields something else that I value most: questioning what is.\n\nBut not questioning in an arrogant way with the belief that we are the ones who are right. It's questioning in an effort to discover the truth. It's assuming that we might be wrong.

In each case this 'something' may be different, but it is always characterized by something important: **there is no way to take it away from us**.\n\nIn theory, it's a bit philosophical, but it's actually very practical. The idea is that the state we are in when we 'have it all' is characterized by a sense of inner [[Tranquility]] and [[Knowledge/Thoughts/Happiness]]. Both of these things are the source of infinite [[Knowledge/Thoughts/Energy]].\n\nAnd now if this state can be taken away from us, because its source is in the things that surround us, then there is a rather good chance that it will be temporary. And I don't even mean extreme things here, such as losing something we have, but even getting used to it.

Dan Millman explains this brilliantly, explaining the difference between the mind and the brain, consciousness, being conscious and active attention:\n\n\u003e I’d better redefine some terms for you. ‘Mind’ is one of those slippery terms like ‘love.’ The proper definition depends on your state of consciousness. Look at it this way: You have a brain that directs the body, stores information, and plays with that information. We refer to the brain’s abstract processes as ‘the intellect.’ Nowhere have I mentioned mind. The brain and the mind are not the same. The brain is real; the mind isn’t. “‘Mind’ is an illusory reflection of cerebral fidgeting. It comprises all the random, uncontrolled thoughts that bubble into awareness from the subconscious. Consciousness is not mind; awareness is not mind; attention is not mind. Mind is an obstruction, an aggravation. It is a kind of evolutionary mistake in the human being, a primal weakness in the human experiment. I have no use for the mind. ~ Dan Millman\n\nIf we take a moment to think about it, indeed the mind is just random, uncontrolled thoughts that appear and disappear, constantly distracting us from what is happening here and now and actively taking action.\n\nFor me, non-thinking is the **most important** skill I develop in myself, including through [[Knowledge/Dictionary/Perspective]], [[Mindfulness]] and [[Knowledge/Thoughts/Boredom]].\n\nDoes this mean that my mind is then devoid of any thoughts? Of course not, because I have no control over them. However, it is possible to function in a mode in which they also have no control over us.\n\nIf you want to experience the state I'm writing about, while outside toss a tennis ball high and do your best to catch it. The moment when your attention will be focused only on this is the moment when thoughts have no control over us. Similarly, this moment is also illustrated by a scene from the movie The Power of Calm (based on the book [[Knowledge/Books/Way of The Peaceful Warrior]]):\n\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/40ZYSJ3A7yM\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e","lastmodified":"2022-10-28T02:40:50.168844759Z","tags":null},"/Knowledge/Thoughts/Odpuszczanie":{"title":"letting go","content":"## What is it about?\n[Knowledge/Thoughts/Emotions]] play an important role in our lives and, in my opinion, serve us as long as we don't let them take full control. Naturally, there is no 'switch' anywhere that decides this, and frankly, a very good thing, because disconnecting from emotions is not a good idea.\n\nIf we care a lot about something, we generate attachment in ourselves, the consequence of which can be pressure, anxiety and various negative emotions that take away our energy and can even poison us and make us unhappy. That's why sometimes it seems that 'the harder we try, the harder it is to achieve something'. I am very often accompanied by a feeling of 'blockedness', related to this very thing. Being aware of this, I often manage to overcome it.\n\nAll of this also has a very negative impact on the [[Knowledge/Thoughts/Decision-making]] process, because it is difficult to approach [[Knowledge/Thoughts/Reality]] while there are a lot of negative emotions inside us. In such situations, it is most helpful to change [[Knowledge/Dictionary/Perspective]], which not infrequently requires us ... that we wait. And it is difficult to wait without letting go of what seems to be everything at the moment.\n\nVery often when I play [[Gran Turismo]] racing against the clock, I experience that I crank out my best laps at a time when I feel a little relaxed and **further care**, but the pressure tension is gone. You could say it's a kind of balance or more like 'dancing on the edge' of pressure and relaxation. It's important to find your place between **relaxation** and **pressure**.\n\n\u003e Take out the trash. The trash is anything that's keeping you from the only thing that matters, this moment.  Here.  Now.  And when you truly are in the here and now, you'll be amazed at what you can do, and how well you can do it. ~ Dan Millman\n\nOne of the most important and at the same time the most difficult to execute (and even to understand itself) is the concept of letting go of 'what we care about most'. Whenever I even think about it, it seems absurd, e.g. how can we be ready to, for example, lose a job we like? Will we stop seeing people we love to spend time with? Will our loved ones leave? How can we even think that this is ok?\n\nI realized that this may be the case the moment I changed my attitude after reading [[Knowledge/Books/Letting Go]]. What's more, it is **necessary** to enjoy what we have, without any limitations and more than ever! A simple example: you visit your parents and see them growing older with each visit. You are aware that this reunion, this Christmas, this family party, may be the last. What then? Do you rejoice or the opposite?\n\n\u003e It's not magic, Tommy.  Just getting rid of all that bullshit you have up in your head that tells you you might not be enough.  So when you get up there, you make every move about the move.  All right?  Not about the gold.  Not about what your dad thinks about you. Not about anything but that one moment in time.\n\nOn the other hand, it can be said that it is enough not to think about it, and in part this can be a good solution. But can we then consciously enjoy every moment? In my opinion, no, but I understood this the moment I said goodbye to one of my loved ones and felt peace combined with a bit of joy. And this, in my opinion, was possible just by letting go.\n\nThe last thing to understand is the difference between **letting go** and **resignation**. Letting go is when we move beyond the negative emotions associated with, for example. **possibility of failure**, **fear of success**, **possibility of making a mistake** but we still do our thing with full [[Enthusiasm]]s and a sense of happiness. In my opinion, it is this state that makes us able to find the energy to overcome adversity.\n\n## What is letting go for me?\nFor me, letting go is a skill that can be developed and a state to be in. It is largely what allows me to carry out my [[Projects/Projects]] and enjoy every moment spent with other people.\n\nPersonally, I experience letting go as a **space** that is created around me in my imagination. It is the moment when I am able to see all the negative [[Knowledge/Thoughts/Emotions]] that are trying to get to me and the thoughts that are trying to distract me. It seems to me that a very important part of forming this skill was the whole [[Foundations/Understanding myself]] and [[Mindfulness]] process. In contrast, the most groundbreaking event was reading [[Knowledge/Books/Letting Go]].\n\nI think it is very important that letting go does not mean that we no longer care. On the contrary. I have a belief that by letting go we show how much we care, by trying to overcome negative emotions and getting rid of selfish motivations to be fully here and now.

Over the years, I have developed my projects using tools that I simply could not afford at the time. I only made sure to update my setup as much as possible to give me the most comfort while still being within my capabilities.\n\n![](https://space.overment.com/Screen-Shot-2021-11-20-14-00-50/Screen-Shot-2021-11-20-14-00-50.png)\n\n## Computer\n- MacBook Pro 2021 14\"\n- Procesor M1 Max - 10 rdzeni CPU / 32 GPU / 16 NE\n- 64 GB RAM\n- 2 TB SSD\n\nMost of the time I work in desktop mode with a monitor [Apple Pro Display XDR](https://www.apple.com/pl/pro-display-xdr/) and Keychron K3 v2 Slim keyboard and Trackpad (Magic Trackpad) connected.\n\n## Video equipment and lighting\nI record video with the help of Sony ZV-1 camcorder (with [dummy battery](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07DMXX9W6/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_asin_title_s00?ie=UTF8\u0026th=1)) And a Razer Seiren microphone with a Rode PSA-1 handle. I capture the image with the help of [[Optimization/Tools/Screenflow]] And I edit in [[FinalCut Pro]]. I use lighting in the form of [[YN-900]](https://yongnuo.com.pl/?p=463) lights.\n\n\u003e I bought a Razer Seiren microphone right at the beginning of the development of my YouTube channel. Taking care of high quality audio is key, although nowadays you can get much cheaper equipment that offers more capabilities.\n\nTo reduce reverberation during recordings, I use acoustic panels from [Addictive Sound](https://addictivesound.pl/), which I highly recommend.\n\n## Desk and chair\nThe desk, which supports the option of standing work, is from the company [Deskwise](https://deskwise.pl/), but because I received it as a gift, I do not have information on the model (it was not indicated anywhere).\n\nIn sitting mode, I use the [Herman Miller Embody Balance] chair(https://sklep.k-r.pl/pl/p/Herman-Miller-Embody-Balance-C7/12)","lastmodified":"2022-10-28T02:40:50.168844759Z","tags":null},"/Optimization/Hardware/StreamDeck":{"title":"Stream Deck","content":"## What is StreamDeck?\nElgato StreamDeck is a kind of auxiliary keyboard, on the keys of which you can display any graphics, including dynamic ones (automatic replacement of photo and description).\n\nIn addition, the keys can change depending on the context (e.g., an open program) and act as folders inside which we have additional buttons.\n\nIt is designed for streamers but is also great for professional programs that require access to multiple options and, of course, [[Optimization/Automation/Automation]].\n\n## How do I use StreamDeck?\nAs of July 2021, I am using [Elgato StreamDeck](https://www.elgato.com/en/stream-deck) as an additional keyboard, used for automation and easy control of macros defined in [[Optimization/Tools/Keyboard Maestro]]\n\nI have StreamDeck version XL and additionally use the ability to define folders.\n\n**Mostly with its help I launch the:**\n- launching groups of notes in [[Optimization/Tools/Obsidian]] / [[Optimization/Tools/Notion]]\n- launching databases from [[Optimization/Tools/Airtable]]\n- running the web pages I open frequently (and not only)\n- music control, including throughout the house\n- switching contexts between projects (workflow automation)\n\n## Automations\nI enjoy discovering new ways to use StreamDeck. Seemingly, it is just an unusual keyboard and in practice it offers very great possibilities.\n\n### Modes of operation\nWhen working, it takes the most time and energy to change the context. I've set up buttons on the main screen linked to activities I want to do regularly. By linking actions to [[Optimization/Tools/Keyboard Maestro]], I can switch between projects and tasks with a single button.\n\n**Examples:** \n- Activate email reply mode (loose music, no DND and activation of Superhuman and browser)\n- The projects I am involved in are folders inside of which there are actions related to them (such as writing articles for the easycart blog or creating podcast scripts for automated)\n- switching between operating modes (focused / loose)\n- signaling that recording is on\n\n### Activating bots\nI categorize my [[Optimization/Automation/Automation]] by bot avatars that perform specific tasks for me. Their scenarios are designed in such a way that they can be combined with each other or called separately.\n\n![](https://space.overment.com/Shared-Image-2022-06-01-14-14-06-gTWCY/Shared-Image-2022-06-01-14-14-06.png)\n\n### Additional observations\nStream Deck works best in conjunction with [[Optimization/Tools/Keyboard Maestro]], as this allows us to assign any macro to a button.\n\nAt the same time, this makes setting up a Stream Deck technically and conceptually challenging, as preparing actually useful macros is not obvious.\n\nThe most important benefit of SD is that you can use it to activate various system functions faster. The downside is that not having access to it (e.g., on a trip with a laptop) disrupts your entire workflow. As a result, I use [[Optimization/Tools/Raycast]] or [[Projects/Design Maestro]] more and more often than Stream Deck.","lastmodified":"2022-10-28T02:40:50.168844759Z","tags":null},"/Optimization/Hardware/iPad":{"title":"iPad","content":"The iPad is, in my opinion, one of the best pieces of electronic music I have ever encountered.\n\n## Applications\n- [[Optimization/Tools/Kindle]] - if I have a tablet with me, I read on it\n- [[Optimization/Tools/Notability]] - I keep a [[Foundations/📓 Journal]] almost every day just on the iPad using the Apple Pencil\n- [[Optimization/Tools/Procreate]] - in my spare time and on trips I draw\n\nIn addition, I have virtually no applications installed on the iPad other than those mentioned above.

Its main advantages are that it works on local [[markdown]] files and allows connections between notes through so-called 'wiki links'. Based on these, it can build content maps.\n\n## How do I use Obsidian?\nFor one purpose only: Developing this project, the so-called Digital Garden. With the help of the [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) project (based on the Hugo framework), I am publishing these notes in the brain.overment.com domain.\n\n### Rules\nAlthough I have read most of the material from people like Tiago Forte, at the same time I have developed most of the principles of note development in Obsidian on my own. In my opinion, Tiago does a great job of organizing the topic but his system is too complex for me. We are certainly different in many ways, so my process had to be tailored to me.\n\n**Principles are.\n- When I write about something and a keyword falls on which I want to say more, I mark it with a link.\n- I use a simple directory organization, that is:\n\t- Foundations - my basis for functioning\n\t- Optimization - my optimization techniques\n\t- Knowledge - what I know\n\t- and Projects - what I do\n- In case I see that a topic takes into account many related issues I create a summary note, which is a collection of likenesses to all topics. According to Tiago, among others, this is called a ToC - Table of Contents.\n- I create content about what I want to explore or what is important to me at the moment. Often the trigger is when someone asks me a question and I see it repeated often, so it would be better to write a note about it instead of answering individually.\n\nAnd that's it. There is nothing beyond that.\n\n### Automation\nTo work with Obsidian, I use [[Optimization/Tools/Keyboard Maestro]] and my [[Projects/Design Maestro]] macros. These enable me to primarily:\n\n- Quickly open selected notes (x-scheme-url e.g. obsidian://open?vault=content\n- Quickly add content (Keyboard Maestro, action Append text to a File)\n- Adding links to very popular topics (as above)\n- making global changes to notes (with the help of [[Regex]])\n- Metadata updates (e.g., time of last file edit interpreted by Quartz)\n- templates for adding notes (text expander)\n\nAn example of using Deisgn Maestro - quickly adding new tools. Executing this macro adds the tool to the ToC list and creates a new note. A link to it goes to the clipboard, so I can open Obsidian very quickly if necessary and if not, I don't have to divert from the task at hand:\n![](https://space.overment.com/Screen-Shot-2022-08-12-14-11-53-xmPJB/Screen-Shot-2022-08-12-14-11-53.png)\nThe above macro is not part of [[Projects/Design Maestro]] and was prepared for my needs. I have analogous macros for Books, Automation or Mental Models.\n### Publication of notes\nMy `vault` is also a repository [[Knowledge/Programming/git/git]]. This means that my notes are stored not only locally on my computer but also in the aforementioned repository.\n\nAt the same time `vault` is placed inside the aforementioned application prepared based on the Quartz project, with the help of which I generate HTML pages and publish them on brain.overment.com with the help of [[Github Actions]] automation.\n\nI have shown the process of configuring Quartz in detail in a video available at [[Projects/Ahoy!]] [Read entry](https://community.ahoy.so/c/nocode-podziel-sie-wiedza/publikacja-notatek-na-obsidian-z-quartz-na-github-pages) and it is also described in quite a bit of detail on the Quartz project website, with some more modifications of my own that I have applied myself. Some of them I mention in the video and some I am still working on.\n\nInterestingly, the updates happen 100% automatically, because the moment Obsidian closes, the Keyboard Maestro macro is launched and:\n- adds changes to the repository\n- sends them to a remote repository\n- data upload launches [[Github Actions]] and thus publishes the notes","lastmodified":"2022-10-28T02:40:50.172844762Z","tags":null},"/Optimization/Tools/Onyx":{"title":"Onyx","content":"This is an application for [[macOS]] that I run once every few months to clean the system of unnecessary items.\n\n![](https://space.overment.com/Screen-Shot-2022-05-02-15-36-27-UfmP3/Screen-Shot-2022-05-02-15-36-27.png)","lastmodified":"2022-10-28T02:40:50.172844762Z","tags":null},"/Optimization/Tools/Paste":{"title":"Paste","content":"This is the best clipboard manager for [[macOS]] that I know of.

I decided to take advantage of this to create a fully customized interface for Design Maestro, which looks as follows:\n\n![](https://space.overment.com/Screen-Shot-2022-05-16-17-45-51-GsQ2U/Screen-Shot-2022-05-16-17-45-51.png)\n\nAt the moment, the entire interface of the application uses JavaScript / HTML / CSS code, but in my opinion, it is even possible there to use, for example, [[Vue]] or [[Svelte]]. Especially since the whole thing is based on a library of macros, which allow you to create more.\n\nDesign Maestro offers, among other things:\n- Adding custom assets and colors for quick selection\n- Color Picker usable anywhere in the system\n- Ability to quickly search Google and Deepl\n- Ability to save quick access URLs\n- Ability to create custom snippets (text expander)\n- Optimize selected images\n- Remove background from selected photos\n\n![](https://space.overment.com/Shared-Image-2022-05-18-09-15-56-Z9bUO/Shared-Image-2022-05-18-09-15-56.png)\n\n\nREADME.md repository https://github.com/iceener/designmaestro (currently private).\n\n# Introduction\nDesignMaestro is a set of macros of Keyboard Maestro which was build on top of [Custom HTML Prompt Action](https://wiki.keyboardmaestro.com/action/Custom_HTML_Prompt?s[]=prompt\u0026s[]=html#Form_Validation). It was designed so creating a new macros are as easy as it possible by by using JSON objects.\n\nAn example prompt looks like this:\n\n![](https://space.overment.com/Shared-Image-2022-05-17-13-37-01-TGsTn/Shared-Image-2022-05-17-13-37-01.png)\n\nA core of this project is an [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) application bundled with [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/) to a single HTML file which may be loaded from `/dist` directory or by pasting it inline to `Custom HTML Prompt Action`.\n\n## Installation\n1. Download this repostiory to your Mac\n2. Go to a directory and run `npm install`\n3. Build project with `npm run build`\n4. Point `index.html` from `dist` directory to `Custom HTML Prompt Action`\n5. After each change make sure you rebuild a project with `npm run build`\n\n## Predefined Macros\nWe have created a set of predefined, plug\u0026play macros you can use right away. DesignMaestro macros were created with designers in mind to improving their work by saving time on repeatitive tasks. \n\n**This includes:** \n- optimizing image file sizes\n- removing backround from selected images\n- saved assets picker\n- saved color picker\n- copy text from selected screen area (with OCR feature)\n- global system picker (copying hex color from pixel which is pointed with a mouse)\n- quick translation \u0026 searching\n- quick creating a figma, notion and webflow projects\n- pasting `Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit interdum hendrerit ex vitae sodales.`\n\nThose macros are available here for free: https://designmaestro.io.\n(Premium set of packages is on a way)\n\n## Create a custom Prompt\nDesignMaestro allows you to create a simple form which contains: \n- a title \u0026 description\n- form inputs (text, textarea, select, color, radio, datetime-local)\n- actions buttons (confirm and cancel)\n\nAn example looks like this:\n\n![](https://space.overment.com/Shared-Image-2022-05-17-14-17-46-tQzvt/Shared-Image-2022-05-17-14-17-46.png)\n\nIn order to generate this prompt like this, basically you have to:\n1. Create a JSON object and save it's stringify version in a `DMLauncher` variable of Keyboard Maestro. \n2. Use `Execute a Macro` action and trigger `(util) Render` macro.\n\nAll input values will be saved in Keyboard Maestro variables and names of those variables will match inputs `name` field. For example: `\u003cinput name=\"example\" /\u003e` value will be saved in a variable with a name `example`. \n\n| Please note that those variables will be saved only if Prompt will be ended with a confirmation (pressing `Enter` or `Primary button`)\n\n**JSON reference both for prompt and lists configuration looks like this:**\n```\n{\n\n  \"type\": \"prompt\", // prompt or list\n  \n  \"actionType\": \"default\", // required only for type: \"list\". default - trigger macro by name | download - downloads a image file and set its content to clipboard | copy - copy a value of list item to a clipboard\n\n  \"header\": {\n\n    \"active\": true,\n\n    \"title\": \"\", // prompt header\n\n    \"description\": \"\"  // prompt description\n\n  },\n\n  \"actions\": { // custom prompt actions\n\n    \"mode\": \"decision\", // decision | confirm.

This is required for `type: prompt`\n\n  \"list\": [] // see a reference below. This is required for `type: list`\n\n}\n```\n\n**JSON reference for inputs looks like this:**\n\nAs you can see it's an array of objects describing each input field.\n\n```json\n[\n\n\t{ // TEXT / TEXTAREA / DATE INPUT FIELD\n\n      \"type\": \"text\", // text | textarea | datetime-local \n\n      \"name\": \"textVar\", // value of this input is connected with KM variable with this name\n\n      \"label\": \"This is a text field\", // input label\n      \n      \"value\": \"default value\", // it can be set right here or by setting a KM Variable with a name coresponding to this input name. \n      \n      \"placeholder\": \"Type something\", // input placeholder\n\n      \"focused\": true, // autofocus.

Make sure to have a single one for each prompt\n\n      \"options\": [ // An array of options \n        { \n          \"label\":\"Label\", // Option label \n          \"value\": \"option1\",  // Option value\n          \"selected\": true // true / false is selected\n        }\n\t  ]\n\t}\n]\n```\n\n**JSON reference for list items looks like this:**\n\nAs you can see it's an array of objects describing each list item.\n\n```\n[\n  {\n\t  \"label\": \"\", // list item main label\n\t  \"value\": \"\", // value of an item. May be: a macro name to trigger, value to be copied to clipboard or an image file needed to be downloaded and copied to clipboard\n\t  \"description\":\"\" // description of an item, is showing on a right side\n\t  \"thumbnail\": \"\" // (optional) url to a thumbnail (must be public and point to the image file)\n  }\n]\n```\n\n## Confirm \u0026 Cancel actions\nWhile prompt is displayed there're two ways to close it: by `confirming`, which means saving a variables to Keyboard Maestro or by `cancelling` and just closing a window. \n\nIn order to make sure that following actions won't be activated, just use `if statement` and check if a variable called `DMContinue` is set to `true`, like so:\n\n![](https://space.overment.com/Shared-Image-2022-05-17-14-35-31-B6KCc/Shared-Image-2022-05-17-14-35-31.png)\n\n## Summary\nIn order to generate a new prompt you need to: \n- create a configuration JSON\n- add `inputs` (for type: prompt) and `list` (for type: list)\n- trigger a macro called `(util) Render` with `Execute a Macro` action.\n\n\n## Known issues\n- ~~Clicking on list item doesn't trigger an action~~\n- ~~Select input default value does not work~~\n- ~~There is no simple way to manage `DMSettings` (only for `Predefined Macros`)~~","lastmodified":"2022-10-28T02:40:50.172844762Z","tags":null},"/Projects/EasyBanner":{"title":"EasyBanner","content":"## What is EasyBanner?\n\nEasyBanner is my microservice to generate jpg / png / pdf files based on HTML / CSS code.\n\nI use it in conjunction with [[Optimization/Tools/MakeHQ]] to create [[Optimization/Automation/Automation]].\n\nCurrently, most of the graphics I post on social media are created from templates and generated with the help of [[Projects/EasyBanner]].\n\n## [[Optimization/Tools/MakeHQ]]\nEasyBanner has its own module in MakeHQ, currently available only to those with purchased access.\n\n![](https://space.overment.com/Shared-Image-2021-11-07-23-26-34/Shared-Image-2021-11-07-23-26-34.png)\n\n## How to gain access?\nEasyBanner is currently available at a subscription of 39 PLN / month.\n\nIt can be purchased through [[Projects/EasyCart]] on the site:\nhttps://app.easycart.pl/checkout/zautomatyzowani/easybanner","lastmodified":"2022-10-28T02:40:50.172844762Z","tags":null},"/Projects/EasyCart":{"title":"EasyCart","content":"---\n\n# What is EasyCart?\nEasyCart is a project that facilitates sales in digital products.
